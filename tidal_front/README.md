# Baroclinic instability generated by a tidal front 

3D model domain with a shelf/ridge topography, linear vertical temperature (density) stratification and barotropic forcing at two open boundaries. The tidal mixing in the shallow region generates a horizontal buoyancy gradient that eventually goes unstable (after ~30 days). 

This case has solid walls at the lateral (along-shelf) domain boundaries.
