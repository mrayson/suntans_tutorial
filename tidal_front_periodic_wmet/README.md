# Baroclinic instability generated by a tidal front (periodic boundary conditions)

3D model domain with a shelf/ridge topography, linear vertical temperature (density) stratification and barotropic forcing at two open boundaries. The tidal mixing in the shallow region generates a horizontal buoyancy gradient that eventually goes unstable (after ~30 days). 

## Notes on periodic grid generation

The grid generation code is in `mfiles/quadgrid.m`. You will need either MATLAB or Octave to run this code. On linux Octave is install via `sudo apt install octave`

Modify the script to change the grid resolution.

Also note that this example has its own `grid.c` file that calculates geometry variables appropriately for a periodic domain.
